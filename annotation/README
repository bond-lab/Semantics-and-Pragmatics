(i) get students
 save xls with name and matric as students.tsv
 comment out non student lines 

# don't commit students.csv

(ii) run assign.py
 set the start and end sid
 set the urls
 you may have to adjust the number of sentences a little to make things fit.

this makes the file for annotation -- copy it to git for the subject

You may need to tweak the final group a little, move the final student into it.

(iii) go to where the annotation is taking place and
 * reset the passwords
 * create DBs:  engA engB .. engE
 * make sure that their owners and permissions are correct (cp -p)
 chown bond:www-data eng[A-D].db
 * maybe make eng.db not writable afterwards
   $ sudo chmod a-w eng.db

(iv) Prepare for phase 2

48505, 49505
C delete 48505-49483

(a) make eng writable again
    $ chmod ug+w eng.db
    $ chmod o-w eng.db
    make eng[A-E] not writable
    $ chmod a-w eng[ABCD].db
    make sure everything is owner by bond:www-data
    make a backup (year-subject/phase2/*) then compress

(b) if a DB only annotates part, set the rest to None
i.e. the corpus that only had one annotator.
UPDATE concept SET  tag=NUll WHERE sid > ??? OR sid < ???.


(c) copy one of the DBs (it doesn't matter which) to a new DB
set target DB, source DB and sids in tag-mfs.py
get sentiment: merge.tsv
$ tag-mfs.py
make the new DB not-writable

This takes a bit of time.


(d) assign the majority tags to eng.db
set DBname, usrname and sids in assign-majtag.py
it will read all of eng[A-E] that exist
$ assign-majtag.py

(e) make sure that agreement.cgi is set up for the right number of databases.


Ready to go!

### change the from/to in tag-mfs.py (and maybe the source corpora)
### this takes a couple of minutes (mainly reading the PWN frequencies
is slow)
tag-mfs.py
### change the from/to in assign-majtag.py

If you can't access the dashboard, restart apache!
 sudo service apache2 restart

Something to do with nginx
