\section{Big Picture}

\begin{itemize}
\item Language can be used to convey information
  \begin{itemize}
  \item we model this as \txx{meaning}
  \item \txx{lexical semantics} looks at relations between words in
    the lexicon
  \item \txx{structural semantics} looks at relations between words in
    utterances
  \item \txx{pragmatics} looks at how and why we use words
  \end{itemize}
\item Meaning is infinite
  \begin{itemize}
  \item it can be built up \txx{compositionally}
  \item it can vary and be extended continuously
  \item we can only model it approximately
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\section{Revision: \\ Introduction to Semantics}

\myslide{What is Semantics}
\begin{itemize}
\item Very broadly, semantics is the study of meaning
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Word meaning
  \item Sentence meaning
  \end{itemize}
\item Layers of Linguistic Analysis
  \begin{enumerate}%\addtolength{\itemsep}{-0.75ex}
  \item Phonetics \& Phonology
  \item Morphology
  \item Syntax
  \item Semantics
  \item Pragmatics
  \end{enumerate}
\item Semantics could be \txx{autonomous} or \txx{integrated} with other knowledge
\end{itemize}

\myslide{Meaning in the larger context}

\begin{itemize}
\item Semiotics is the study of interpreting symbols, or \txx{signification}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item We refer to the \txx{signified}
  \item Using a \txx{signifier}\hfill Saussure
  \end{itemize}
\item Problems with defining meaning
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The \txx{grounding} problem and \txx{circularity}
  \item The boundaries of meaning: \txx{linguistic} vs \txx{encyclopedic knowledge}
  \item Individual variation in meaning: \txx{idiolects}
  \item Words can be combined to form an infinite number of expressions
    \begin{itemize}
    \item This building up of meaning is referred to as \txx{composition}
    \item If the meaning of the whole can be deduced from the parts then it is \txx{compositional}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\myslide{Metalanguages and Notational Conventions}

We use language to talk about language, which can get messy.  So we
use certain words with very specific technical senses, and we use
fonts to convey information.

\begin{itemize}
\item \eng[gloss]{word} or \eng{utterance} 
  \hfill (\textbf{\emp{do}} this in your assignments!)
\item \lex{lexeme}
\item \iz{predicate}
\item \con{concept}
\item \txx{technical term} $\leftarrow$ remember me!
\end{itemize}

\myslide{Utterances, Sentences and Propositions}

\begin{itemize}
\item \txx{utterance}: an actual instance of saying (or writing  or \ldots) something
\item \txx{sentence}: an abstraction, the type of what was said
  \begin{exe}
    \ex Caesar invades Gaul
  \end{exe}
\item \txx{proposition}: a further abstraction, normally ignoring some non-literal meaning
  \begin{exe}
    \ex \iz{invade(Caesar, Gaul)}
  \end{exe}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \txx{information structure}: what part of a proposition is emphasized
 \begin{exe}
   \ex Caesar invaded Gaul
   \ex Gaul was invaded by Caesar
   \ex It was Gaul that  Caesar invaded
   \ex It was Caesar who invaded Gaul
  \end{exe}
  \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\myslide{Information Theory}
\MyLogo{not in Saeed}
\begin{itemize}
\item Language has many uses, only one of which is to convey information
%  \\ \textit{A bit of Fry and Laurie Season 1 Episode 2}
  \\ --- but surely transferring information is important
\vspace*{-1ex}
\item We can measure information in a limited, technical, and very useful, sense
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Think of a \txx{signal} being transmitted from a source to a
    destination, possibly with \txx{noise} in the channel
  \item Measure information in \txx{bits}: 
    \\ the number of yes/no questions needed to determine a term
  \item Context can help decoding due to \txx{Mutual Information}
  \end{itemize}
\vspace*{-1ex}
\item How can we get our message across efficiently and safely
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \txx{Optimal encoding} can make the transmission efficient
    \\ Frequent expressions should be short
  \item \txx{Redundant encoding} can make the transmission robust
    \\ So we can understand even with noise
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

  \put(50,37){\vector(1,-0.35){26}}
  \put(75,33){\makebox(0,0){Represent}}
 \end{picture}

 \txx{Representational view} is focused on how relationships between
 expressions (words, sentences) and things in the world are mediated by
 the mind (cognitive linguistics).  (More in Chapters 9 and 11)

\myslide{Two types of naming}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \txx{The description theory}: Names are like short hands for descriptions:
\begin{quote}
  William Shakespeare = ``the playwright who wrote Hamlet''  
\end{quote}
\item \txx{The causal theory}:
Names begin with some event of naming (e.g. a christening) before
becoming commonly accepted.
\begin{quote}
  William Shakespeare = ``the guy other people call William Shakespeare''  
\end{quote}
\end{itemize}

\myslide{Mental Representations}

\begin{itemize}
\item Divide meaning into
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \txx{reference}: the relation to the world
  \item \txx{sense}: the rest of the meaning
  \end{itemize}
\item Introduce \txx{concepts}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Classic view is to represent by \txx{Necessary and Sufficient
      Conditions}: \txx{definitional} view of meaning
    \\ \lex{bachelor} is an unmarried male adult.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\myslide{Prototype Theory}

\begin{itemize}
\item Some members of a category are more typical and more 
  salient than other members of the same category. (Rosch)
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Membership is not just IN/OUT but graded
  \item Members may share some attributes but not all
  \item Categories are culture dependant
 \item Concepts are organized in groups around a \txx{prototype}
    \item These have typical members (remembered as \txx{exemplars}) 
\item prototypes have \txx{characteristic feature}s
\item Some categories (concepts) are seem to be more psychologically basic than others: \txx{basic level categories}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item You only need to store detailed knowledge about BLCs
  \item Other things are then compared to them
  \item Makes it quicker and easier to compute similarities and differences
  \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\myslide{Basic Level Categories}

\begin{itemize}
\item Some categories (concepts) are more basic than others
  \begin{itemize}
  \item  maximize the number of attributes shared by members of the category
  \item  minimize the number of attributes shared with other categories
  \end{itemize}
\item They have various properties
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Pictures of objects are categorized faster at the basic level
  \item Basic level names used more often in free-naming tasks
  \item Children learn them earlier
  \item Basic-level names are more common in adult discourse
  \item Basic-level categories are common in different cultures
  \item Basic level names tend to be short
  \item Basic-level names tend to be common in compound nouns
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\myslide{Linguistic Relativity}

\begin{itemize}
\item The language we think in makes some concepts easy to express,
  and some concepts hard
\item The idea behind \txx{linguistic relativity} is that this will
  effect how you think
\item Do we really think in language? 
  \begin{itemize}
  \item We can think of things we don't have words for
  \item Language under-specifies meaning
  \end{itemize}
\item Maybe we store a more abstract representation
\\ \txx{the language of thought} or \txx{Mentalese}
\end{itemize}


\section{Revision: \\ Word Meaning}

\myslide{Words} 
\MyLogo{We saw issues with MWEs in the assignment}
\begin{description}
\item \txx{word} slippery to define: orthographic, phonological, conceptual definitions mainly overlap
\item  \txx{lexeme} base (uninflected) form of a word (or multi word expression)
\item  \txx{vagueness} having an underspecified meaning
\item  \txx{ambiguous} having more than one possible meaning
\item  \txx{content word} with a denotation (typically open class : \txx{lexical word})
\item  \txx{function word} no denotation (typically closed class:
  \txx{grammatical word}, \txx{structural word})
\end{description}

\myslide{Senses and Relations}

\begin{description}
\item  \txx{polysemous} having multiple meanings
  \begin{itemize}
  \item this implies that words are somehow divided into senses
  \item presumably we remember them: so we have an inventory
  \item if there is no mechanism for extension then this is a
    \txx{fixed sense inventory}
  \item how we \txx{generate} meaning \txx{dynamically} is a hot research topic
  \end{itemize}
\item  \txx{monosemous} having just one meaning
\item  \txx{homonyms} words unrelated meaning; grammatically equivalent;
  with identical forms
\end{description} 


\myslide{Lexical Relations}
\begin{description}
\item \txx{synonymy}  all meanings identical; in all contexts; descriptive and non-
\item \txx{hyponymy} is-a, kind-of: supertype \textbf{hypernym}; subtype \textbf{hyponym}
\item \txx{meronymy} part-whole: part \textbf{meronym}; whole \textbf{holonym}
\item \txx{antonymy} (complementary, gradable, reverse, converse, taxonomic sisters)
\item \txx{member-collection} member of a group (\eng{tree-forest})
\item \txx{portion-mass} element of stuff (\eng{grain-rice})
\item \txx{domain}  used in a domain (\eng{[software] driver -golf})
\end{description}


\section{Revision: \\ Sentence Relations and Truth}

\myslide{Logic}

\begin{itemize}
\item Classical logic is an attempt to find valid principles of argument and inference.
\\[2ex]
\begin{tabular}{llr}
  $a$ & If something is human then it is mortal & \txx{premise}\\
  $b$ & Socrates is human & \txx{premise}\\ \hline
  $c$ & Socrates is mortal & \txx{conclusion}
\end{tabular}
\item Can we go from $a$ and $b$ to $c$? \hfill {\large Yes}
\item Truth is \txx{empirical}: The premises need to correspond with
  the facts of the world
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Sentences have \txx{truth values} (true, false or unknown)
  \item The state of the world that makes a sentence true or false are its \txx{truth conditions}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\myslide{Methods of Argument}

\begin{itemize}
\item \txx{Modus Ponens}
\\[2ex]
  \begin{tabular}{ll}

    $b$ & Zeus is not mortal \\ \hline
    $c$ & Zeus is not human
  \end{tabular}
\\ $p \rightarrow q, \neg q \models \neg p$

\newpage
\item \txx{Hypothetical syllogism}
\\[2ex]
 \begin{tabular}{ll}
    $a$ & If something is human then it is mortal \\
    $b$ & If something is mortal then it dies \\ \hline
    $c$ & If something is human then it dies
  \end{tabular}
\\ $p \rightarrow q, q \rightarrow r \models p \rightarrow r$
\item \txx{Disjunctive syllogism}
\\ (modus tollendo ponens: affirm by denying)
\\[2ex]
 \begin{tabular}{ll}
    $a$ & Either a human is mortal or a human is immortal \\
    $b$ & A human is not immortal \\ \hline
    $c$ & A human is mortal
  \end{tabular}
\\ $p \vee q, \neg q \models p$  (also true that $\neg p \models q$)
\\ $p \oplus q, \neg q \models p$  (also true that $\neg p \models q$)
\\ $p \oplus q, q \models \neg p$  (also true that $p \models \neg q$)
\end{itemize}


\myslide{Empirical truths and connectives}
% \begin{itemize}
% \item \txx{and} ($p \wedge q$)
% \item \txx{or}  ($p \vee q$: disjunction, inclusive or)
% \item \txx{xor} ($p \oplus q$: exclusive or, either or)
% \item \txx{if} ($p \rightarrow q$: if then, material implication)
% % If it doesn’t rain, p = F, the conditional claim cannot be
% % invalidated by whatever is done. (q= T or q =F). p is a
% % sufficient but not necessary condition for q. Some other
% % factor might want to cause me to go to the movies!
% % But not all if.. then…constructions work like that. What are
% % some counterexamples that you can think of? If she is smart,
% % then I would win the Nobel prize (counterfactuals)
% \item \txx{iff} ($p \equiv q$: if and only if) 
%   ($(p \rightarrow q) \wedge (q \rightarrow p)$)
% \item \txx{not} ($\neg p$: contradiction)
% \end{itemize}

  \end{tabular}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Words themselves often carry more implications
    \\ \eng{I did A and B} often implies \eng{I did A first}
  \item There are many ways of saying the operations
  \end{itemize}
\end{center}


\myslide{Necessary Truth, A Priori Truth and Analyticity}
\begin{itemize}
\item Arguments from the speaker's knowledge
\begin{itemize}
\item \txx{A priori} truth is truth that is known without experience.
\item \txx{A posteri} truth is truth known from empirical testing.
\end{itemize}
\item Arguments from the facts of the world
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \txx{Necessary truth} is truth that cannot be denied without forcing a
    contradiction.
  \item \txx{Contingent truth} can be contradicted depending on the facts.
  \end{itemize}
\item Arguments from our model of the world
\begin{itemize}
\item \txx{Analytic truth} Truth follows from meaning relations  within the sentence.
\\ \emp{can include word meaning}
\item \txx{Synthetic truth} Agrees with facts of the world.
\end{itemize}
%\item Normally these give the same results, but not always.  Why?
% \\ \textit{Consuming gum is allowed in Singapore}
% \\ Contingent truth? Why?
\end{itemize}

% If we include our model of word meaning in our reasoning, then \eng{an
%   apple is a fruit} is \textbf{analytic}.  So it is important to have
% an explicit model: these models are typically called \txx{ontologies}.

% \begin{itemize}
% \item What about \eng{the apple of my eye}?
% \end{itemize}

% Building an \txx{inference engine} is actually very, very hard, \ldots
% \\ But very useful for question answering

\myslide{Entailment}


\begin{itemize}
\item \txx{Entailment} \\[2ex]
  \begin{tabular}{ll}
    $a$ &The evil overlord  assassinated the man in the red shirt. \\ \hline
    $b$ &The man  in the red shirt died.
  \end{tabular}
  \\[2ex]
  A sentence $p$ entails a sentence $q$ when the truth of the first ($p$)
  guarantees the truth of the second ($q$), and the falsity of the
  second ($q$) guarantees the falsity of the first ($p$).
\item Sources of Entailment
\begin{itemize}
\item Hyponyms
  \begin{exe}
    \ex \eng{I rescued a dog today. \textnormal{vs} I rescued an animal today.}
  \end{exe}
\item Paraphrases
  \begin{exe}
    \ex \eng{My mom baked a cake.\textnormal{vs}  A cake was baked by my mom.}
  \end{exe}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\myslide{Presuppositions}

\begin{itemize}
\item Many statements assume the truth of something else
  \begin{exe}
    \ex   \begin{xlist}
    \ex \eng{Kim's spouse bakes the best pies.} %(presupposing sentence p)}
    \ex \eng{Kim has a spouse.} %(presupposition q)}
    \end{xlist}
  \end{exe}
\item Negating the presupposing sentence $a$ doesn't affect the presupposition $b$
 whereas negating an entailing sentence destroys the entailment.
\item Sources of Presuppositions
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Names presuppose that their referents exist
  \item Clefts (\eng{it was X that Y}); Time adverbials; Comparatives
  \item Factive verbs: \eng{realize}; 
    some judgement verbs: \eng{blame}; \ldots
%    some change of state: \eng{stop}
  \end{itemize}
\item Presupposition is one aspect of a speaker’s strategy of
organizing information for maximum clarity for the listener.
\end{itemize}

\myslide{What is Deixis}
\begin{itemize}
\item any linguistic element whose interpretation
  necessarily makes reference to properties of the
  extra-linguistic context in which they occur is \txx{deictic}
  \begin{description}
  \item  \txx{Person} relative to the speaker and addressee
  \item  \txx{Spatial Location} demonstratives; \ldots
  \item  \txx{Temporal Location} tense; \eng{yesterday, today, tomorrow}
 \item[Social] relative to the social status: \eng{professor, you, uncle, boy}
  \end{description}
\item Discourse deixis: referring to a linguistic expression or chunk of discourse
\end{itemize}

More than 90\% of the declarative sentences people utter are indexical
in that they involve implicit references to the speaker, addressee,
time and/or place of utterance in expressions like first and second
person pronouns, demonstratives, tenses, and adverbs like here, now,
yesterday (Bar-Hillel 1954: 366).

\myslide{Spatial Deixis}

\begin{itemize}
\item Two way systems (English, \ldots)
  \\[2ex] \begin{tabular}{llll}

    \txx{distal} &\lex{that} & \lex{there} & far to the speaker 
  \end{tabular}
\item Three way systems (Japanese, \ldots)
    \\[2ex] \begin{tabular}{llll}
      \txx{proximal}& \lex{kore} ``this'' & \lex{koko} ``here'' & close to speaker\\
      \txx{medial} &\lex{sore} ``that''   & \lex{soko} ``there'' &close to addressee\\
      \txx{distal} &\lex{are} ``that'' & \lex{asoko} ``over there'' &far from both \\
      \hline
      \txx{interrogative} & \lex{dore} ``which'' & \lex{doko} ``where'' & question 
    \end{tabular}
  \item Can decompose: \lex{this} ``this thing'', \lex{here} ``this place'', \lex{where} ``what place''
 \lex{now} ``this time'',  \lex{then} ``that time'', \lex{when} ``what time''

\end{itemize}

  \end{tabular}
\item Often combined with
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \txx{gender}: \lex{he/she/it }
  \item \txx{number}: \lex{I/we}, 
    \lex{'anta} ``you:m'', \lex{'antumaa} ``you:dual'',  \lex{'antum} ``you:m:pl''
    \\ (Arabic)
  \item \txx{inclusion}: \lex{n\'uy} ``we including you'',  \lex{n\'{\i}i} ``we excluding you'' (Zayse)
  \item \txx{honorification}: \lex{kimi} ``you:inferior'', \lex{anata} ``you:equal'',
    \\ don't use pronouns for superiors: \lex{sensei} ``teacher'', \ldots (Japanese)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\myslide{Social Deixis}

In European languages, a two-way choice in 2nd person pronominal

\item Shift from asymmetric use showing \txx{power} (superior uses \lex{du}; inferior uses \lex{vous}) to symmetric use showing \txx{solidarity} (strangers use  \lex{vous}; intimates use \lex{du}): typically the socially superior person must invite the socially
  inferior person to use the familiar form

\section{Revision: Cognitive Semantics}

\myslide{Introduction}

\begin{itemize}
\item Cognitive linguistics, in general, sees language as crucially embedded in its use
  \begin{itemize}
  \item a \txx{functional} approach to language
  \item considering \txx{diachronic} and not just \txx{synchronic} evidence
  \item little or no separation between syntax, semantics and pragmatics
  \end{itemize}
\item The basic idea is that one thing is characterized in terms of another
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \txx{Metaphor} and \txx{figurative} language
  \item \txx{Image Schemas}
  \item \txx{Mental Spaces}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\myslide{Metaphors and Mechanisms of Interpretation}

\begin{itemize}
\item A metaphor is an extension of the use of a word beyond its
primary meaning to describe referents that bear similarities to
the word’s primary referent.
\begin{itemize}
\item Words need to be similar but not too similar
  \begin{exe}
    \ex $^\#$\eng{wine is whiskey}
    \ex $^\#$\eng{their knees are penguins}
    \ex \eng{life is like the MRT}
  \end{exe}
\end{itemize}
\item \txx{Grammaticalization}: Once a metaphor becomes accepted,
  speakers tend to view the metaphorical meaning as separated from its
  primary meaning
  \begin{exe}
    \ex \eng{booking a flight}
    \end{exe}
\newpage
\item Humans understand words by referring to a prototypical usage,
and they match a new example against the characteristics of the
prototype.
\item  Use of words with broken typicality conditions is very common.
\\ Lakoff: \emp{\Large our conceptual system is fundamentally
metaphorical in nature}.
\item Features of Metaphor
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Conventional
  \item Systematic
  \item Asymmetrical
  \end{itemize}
\item  Metaphors enable us to understand one
  domain of experience (\txx{target}) in terms of another (\txx{source}).
\hfill (Lakoff and Turner, 1989)
\end{itemize}


\myslide{Metaphors we live by}

\begin{itemize}
\item Metaphor is pervasive in everyday life, not just in
language but in thought and action.
\item Our ordinary conceptual system, in terms of which we
both think and act, is fundamentally metaphorical in
nature.
\item If we are right in suggesting that our conceptual system
is largely metaphorical, then the way we think, what we
experience, and what we do every day is very much a
matter of metaphor.

\begin{itemize}
\item Embodied Construction Grammar
  \begin{itemize}
  \item  sources domains are based on our understanding
  \end{itemize}
\item Metaphor and Politics
  \begin{itemize}
\item Political groups base their
  understanding of the world on different metaphors
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \txx{nurturant parent} (liberal) family is one that revolves
    around every family member caring for and being cared for by every
    other family member, with each family member pursuing their own vision of
    happiness.
  \item \txx{strict father} (conservative) family revolves around the idea that parents teach their children how to be self-reliant and self-disciplined through "tough love". 
  \end{itemize}
  It is hard to talk across the different conceptualizations
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\myslide{Other approaches to the same basic idea}
\begin{itemize}
\item \txx{Image schemas}: Fundamental organizing principle of
  metaphors
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Containment schema
  \item Path schema
  \item Force schema
  \end{itemize}
\item \txx{Mental Spaces} are very like Possible Worlds
  \begin{itemize}
  \item However, mental spaces do not contain a faithful
    representation of reality, but an idealized cognitive model.
  \end{itemize}
\item We typically build multiple Mental Spaces

  \begin{quote}
  An explication is a paraphrase composed in the simplest 
  possible terms, thus avoiding circularity and obscurity. No 
  technical terms, ‘fancy words’, logical symbols, or

  contain only simple expressions from ordinary natural 
  language.

  \item Example: Containment, Path and Force
  \end{itemize}
\item Metaphors and polysemy
\end{itemize}

\myslide{Cognitive Metaphors}

\begin{itemize}
\item We continuously use words with extended meanings: metaphors
  \begin{quote}
    A metaphor is an extension of the use of a word beyond its primary
    meaning to describe referents that bear similarities to the
    word’s primary referent.
  \end{quote}
\item Many metaphorical extensions are so common that we no longer
  think of them as metaphors, but just new meanings.
\item Lakoff:  our conceptual system is fundamentally metaphorical in nature.
\\ There is no separation between cognition and linguistics knowledge (Cognitive semantics) 

\end{itemize}

\myslide{What makes a Metaphor}

\begin{itemize}
\item A \emp{source domain} (typically grounded in human experience)
\item A \emp{target domain} (that is similar in some way, but not too similar)
\item A \emp{mapping} between them
\\ typically the mapping will support many metaphorical expressions

\item ``Metaphors enable us to understand one domain of experience in terms of another.''
[Lakoff and Turner 1989]
\end{itemize}


\myslide{Example}

\begin{itemize}
\item  \eng{The English Language is full of these pitfalls}
\item The source and target domains are not just words, but conceptual schemas 
  \begin{description}
  \item[Source] Journey ---  moving from A to B for a purpose
  \item[Target] Using English ---  saying something in English
  \item[Mapping] both have start and finish, they can be successful
    and unsuccessful, there can be obstacles
  \item[Example] pitfall stops someone reaching a successful conclusion; 
    failure to resolve syntactic ambiguity has the same effect: ambiguity = hidden trap

  \item Neurophysical response to red, green, yellow, blue
  \end{itemize}
\item CA, Prototype theory, NSM
\item Evolutionary implications for languages
\end{itemize}



\myslide{Is Colour naming arbitrary}
\begin{itemize}
\item Is color naming across languages largely a matter of arbitrary linguistic convention?
  \begin{itemize}
  \item colour terms of different languages differ, but they agree on focal hues.
  \item only about 30 (of 300) were ever nominated as focal hues for basic colour terms.
  \item When languages are compared – there appeared to be a fixed evolutionary sequence.
  \end{itemize}
\item Do cross-language differences in color naming cause corresponding differences in color cognition?
  \begin{itemize}
  \item A bit, according to very subtle experiments
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\myslide{Basic Color Terms}
\begin{itemize}
\item  Simplicity of form: It should be a monolexeme; that is, its meaning is not predictable from the meaning of its parts

\item Its meaning is not included in that of any other color term. 

\item Its application must not be restricted to a narrow class of objects. 

\item It must be psychologically salient for informants. 
% (1) a tendency to occur at the beginning of elicited list of color terms, 
% (2) stability of reference across informants and across occasions of use
% (3) occurrence in the ideolects of all informants.

\item It should have the same distributional potential as other basic terms.
\item Colour terms, that are also the name of an object characteristically having that color are suspect, for example, gold, silver, and ash.
\item  Recent foreign loan words may be suspect. 
\end{itemize}

\myslide{Focal Colours}

\begin{itemize}
\item Human beings have a direct neurophysiological response to just four hues in the colour spectrum (DeValois \& Jacobs 1968)
  \\ \emp{RED}, \textcolor{yellow}{YELLOW}, \grn{GREEN}, \blu{BLUE}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item These are the \textbf{focal colours}
  \end{itemize}
\item The semantics of basic colour terms in all languages directly reflect  these  neural response categories.
\item Boundaries of colour categories are not variable but determined by the foci of the adjacent primary colour categories.
\end{itemize}

\myslide{Colour Hierarchy B\&K}
\newcommand{\col}[1]{\textcolor{#1}{#1}}
\begin{enumerate}
\item all languages contain terms for white and black
\item all languages also have a term for \col{red} 
\item A four term language adds either a term for \col{yellow} or one for \col{green}
\item A five term language has terms for both \col{yellow} and \col{green}.
\item A six term language has a term for \col{blue}
\item A seven term language adds \col{brown} 
\item If a language has eight or more terms then it has a term for 
  \col{purple}, \col{pink}, \col{orange}, grey or some combination of these.
\end{enumerate}

\myslide{Colour Hierarchy K\&M}
\begin{enumerate}
\item light warm versus dark-cool
\item  light warm composite begins to be differentiated
\item  components of primary colours are teased out in 3a or 3b. Both achromatic primaries are extracted leaving chromatic composites.
\item  last composite - grue
\item  all primary colours
\item  brown
\end{enumerate}

\myslide{Basis for  Semantic change}
\begin{description}
\item [Metonymy]

\item [Synecdoche ]
Refers to a given semantic notion by naming its most prominent or salient part.
\item [Hyperbole]

  \end{itemize}
\item Anaphoric elements
  \begin{itemize}
  \item are semantically underspecified, thus are referentially dependent upon their
