% \myslide{Course Content}

% This course introduces basic corpus skills for linguists:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Marking up extra information
% \item Selecting text
% \item The range of existing corpora
% \item How to build your own corpus
% \item Using corpora to test linguistic hypotheses
% \item Using corpora to train language tools

\myslide{What do you learn?}


Students will learn semantics at an introductory level and they will
acquire semantic analysis skills. With these skills and their
knowledge of semantic approaches, students will be able to approach
natural language data, as well as develop awareness of the inherent
connections between semantics and other branches of linguistics.

\myslide{Student Responsibilities}

By remaining in this class, the student agrees to:
\begin{enumerate}
\item  Make a good-faith effort to learn and enjoy the material.
\item  Read assigned texts, participate in class discussions and
  activities.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Question marks mean I will ask you something\task
  \end{itemize}
\item Submit assignments on time.
\item Attend class at all times, barring special circumstances (see below).
\item Get help early: approach us when you first have trouble understanding a concept or homework problem rather than complaining about a lack of understanding afterward.
\item Treat other students with respect in all class-related activities, including on-line discussions.
\end{enumerate}
\myslide{Attendance}
\begin{enumerate}
\item You are expected to attend all classes.
\item Be on time - lateness is disruptive to your own and others' learning.
\item Valid reasons for missing class include the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item A medical emergency (including mental health emergencies)
\item A family emergency (death, birth, natural disaster, etc)
\item A non-movable special event (sports competition, interview,
  nobel peace prize, \ldots{})
\end{enumerate}
You must provide documentation to the student office who then contacts
me.
\item There will be significant material covered in class that is not in your readings.  You cannot expect to do well without coming to class.
\item If you miss a class, it is your responsibility to get the notes, any handouts you missed, schedule changes, etc. from a classmate.
\end{enumerate}

\myslide{Remediation and Academic Integrity}
\begin{enumerate}
\item No late work will be accepted, except in the case of a documented excuse.
\item For planned, justified, absences on class days or days on which assignments are due, advance notice must be provided.
\item Cheating will not be tolerated. Violations, including plagiarism, will be seriously dealt with, and could result in \textbf{a failing grade for the entire course}.
\item For all other issues of academic integrity, refer to the University Honour Code 
\item As always, use your common sense and conscience.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Introduction to Semantics}

\myslide{What is Semantics?}
\begin{itemize}
\item Very broadly, semantics is the study of meaning
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Word meaning
  \item Sentence meaning
  \item Meaning in context
  \end{itemize}
\item Why do we want to study meaning?
\item What kind of knowledge does it take for a speaker to produce language and for a hearer to comprehend language? 
\end{itemize}

\myslide{Layers of Linguistic Analysis}
\begin{enumerate}\addtolength{\itemsep}{-0.75ex}
\item Phonetics \& Phonology
\item Morphology
\item Syntax
\item Semantics
\item Pragmatics
\end{enumerate}
Two theories
\begin{itemize}
\item Semantics is \txx{autonomous}, a separate module
\item Semantics is \txx{integrated} with other knowledge, inseparable
  \begin{itemize}
  \item linguistic knowledge is inseparable from encyclopedic knowledge
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\myslide{Do we share a common conceptual system?}

\begin{itemize}
\item What is a \lex{high school}?
\item What color is \lex{blue}?
\item What is  \lex{carrot cake}?
\item What does \lex{verb} mean?
\end{itemize}

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{pics/verbing.jpg}

\myslide{Meaning is an open-ended conceptual system}

\begin{itemize}
\item Lexical innovation
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \lex{Meritocracy} (1958)
  \item \lex{LASER} (1960)
  \item \lex{WWW}
  \item[\ldots]
  \end{itemize}
\item   Is this association between creating new words and creating
  new concepts  justified?
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Can we have a new concept without a new word?\task
    %%%
  \item Can we have a new word without a new concept?\task
    %%% 
  \end{itemize}
\item More creativity
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \eng{I am so hungry I can eat ten million elephants.}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

% \myslide{\textbf{Meaning} is}
% \MyLogo{Leech (1981)}

% \begin{itemize}
% \item An intrinsic property
% \item The other words annexed to a word in the dictionary
% \item The connotation of a word
% \item The place of anything in a system
% \item The practical consequences of a thing in our future experiences
% \newpage
% \item That to which the user of a symbol
%   \begin{itemize}
%   \item actually refers to
%   \item ought to be referring
%   \item believes themself to be referring
%   \end{itemize}
% \item That to which the interpreter of a symbol
%   \begin{itemize}
%   \item (a) refers
%   \item (b) believes themself to be referring
%   \item (c) believes the user to be referring
%   \end{itemize}
% \end{itemize}

\myslide{More Meaning}
\begin{quotation}
  We can define the meaning of a speech form accurately when this
  meaning has to do with some matter of which we possess scientific
  knowledge. We can define the names of minerals, for example, in
  terms of chemistry and mineralogy, as when we say that the ordinary
  meaning of the English word \eng{salt} is ‘sodium chloride (NaCl)’, and we
  can define the names of plants or animals by means of the technical
  terms of botany or zoology, but we have no precise way of defining
  words like \eng{love} or \eng{hate}, which concern situations that have not been
  accurately classified – and these latter are in the great majority.
				
\hfill				\textit{Language} \citep{Bloomfield:1933}
\end{quotation}

\begin{itemize}
\item But is \lex{salt} really just NaCl?
\item And what about non-scientific speakers? 
\end{itemize}

\myslide{Determining meaning}

Some useful concepts

\begin{itemize}
\item \txx{Synonymy}: $A$ means the same as $B$
\item \txx{Contradiction}:  $A$ and $B$ cannot both be true
\item \txx{Entailment}: if  $A$ is true then  $B$ must also be true
\item \txx{Ambiguous}: $A$ has more than one meaning
\end{itemize}

\myslide{Meaning in the larger context}

\begin{itemize}
\item Semiotics is the study of interpreting symbols, or \txx{signification}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item We refer to the \txx{signified}
  \item Using a \txx{signifier}\hfill Saussure
  \end{itemize}
\item Signs can be more or less related to their objects
\\  \begin{tabular}[lcc]{lllc}
    \txx{icon} & map or diagram & Children Crossing &
    \includegraphics[width=0.1\textwidth]{pics/ryanlerch-children-crossing-road-sign.pdf}

    \includegraphics[width=0.1\textwidth]{pics/Japanese-stop-sign.pdf} 
  \end{tabular}
\item Are words icons, indexes or symbols?\task
\end{itemize}

\myslide{Problems with defining meaning}

\begin{itemize}
\item The \txx{grounding} problem and \txx{circularity}
\item The boundaries of meaning: \txx{linguistic} vs \txx{encyclopedic knowledge}
\item Regional variation in meaning: \txx{dialects} ``the usage or vocabulary that is characteristic of a specific group of people''
\item Individual variation in meaning: 
\txx{idiolects} ``the language or speech of one individual at a
particular period in life''
\item There is a shared usage of words and meanings that defines a language
\end{itemize}

\myslide{Metalanguages and Notational Conventions}

We use language to talk about language, which can get messy.  So we
try to use certain words with very specific technical senses.

\begin{itemize}
\item \txx{technical term} $\leftarrow$ remember me!
\item \eng[gloss]{word} or \eng{utterance}
\item \lex{lexeme}
\item \iz{predicate}
\end{itemize}

\myslide{Word Meaning and Sentence Meaning}

\begin{itemize}
\item We store information about words in our \txx{mental lexicon}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item It is still unclear what exactly a word is!
  \end{itemize}
\item Words can be combined to form an infinite number of expressions
  \begin{itemize}
  \item This building up of meaning is referred to as \txx{composition}
  \item If the meaning of the whole can be deduced from the parts then it is \txx{compositional}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\myslide{Reference and Sense}

\begin{itemize}
\item Words \txx{refer} to things in the world (like the  \iz{unicorn})
\item The meaning of a word across different contexts is often referred to as its \txx{sense}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Same word can refer to different things
    \begin{itemize}
    \item English: \eng{I put my money in the \ul{bank}}
    \item English: \eng{I fell asleep at the river \ul{bank}}
    \end{itemize}
  \item Same basic concept can have different boundaries
    \begin{itemize}
    \item French: \eng[sheep/mutton]{mouton}
    \item English: \eng{sheep} vs \eng{mutton}
      
    \item Japanese: \eng[dove/pigeon]{hato}
    \item English: \eng{dove} vs \eng{pigeon}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\myslide{Utterances, Sentences and Propositions}

\begin{itemize}
\item \txx{utterance}: an actual instance of saying (or writing  or \ldots) something
\item \txx{sentence}: an abstraction, the type of what was said
  \begin{exe}
    \ex Caesar invades Gaul
  \end{exe}
\item \txx{proposition}: a further abstraction, normally ignoring some non-literal meaning
  \begin{exe}
    \ex \iz{invade(Caesar, Gaul)}
  \end{exe}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \txx{information structure}: what part of a proposition is emphasized
 \begin{exe}
   \ex \eng{Caesar invaded Gaul}
   \ex \eng{Gaul was invaded by Caesar}
   \ex \eng{It was Gaul that  Caesar invaded}
   \ex \eng{It was Caesar who invaded Gaul}
  \end{exe}
  \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
\myslide{Propositions}
\begin{itemize}
\item A logical construct
\item Abstracts away from grammatical differences
\begin{exe}
  \ex \eng{John kicked the dog}
  \ex \eng{The dog was kicked by John}
  \ex  \ja{ジョン~が~犬~を~蹴っ~た~.} \jpn{John-ga inu-wo ketta.}
\end{exe}
\item Can be reasoned over (\txx{logic})
\item Can be formalized
\\ \iz{∃x,y(named(John,x),dog(y),the(y),kick(e,x,y),past(e))}
\end{itemize}

\myslide{Non-literal meaning}
\begin{itemize}
\item Consider “That Mitchell  and Webb Look”
\\ Season One Episode Two 1:10--
\begin{itemize}
\item Why aren’t they more direct?\task
\item Is the meaning clear anyway?\task
\end{itemize}
\item Can you give some examples of non-literal meaning?\task
\end{itemize}

\myslide{Teaching Meaning through Annotating Text}
%\MyLogo{some of the things I make/let my students do}

\begin{itemize}\addtolength{\itemsep}{-1ex}
\item Read a Sherlock Holmes story
  \begin{itemize}
  \item  So far \sh{SPEC}, \sh{DANC}, \sh{REDH} and \sh{SCAN}
\\ (also news, essays and Japanese short stories)
  \end{itemize}
\item Look at every content word
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Find its meaning in a dictionary (wordnet)
  \item Or write a new definition if needed
  \item Say if it has positive or negative connotation (for some)
  \end{itemize}
  this shows what you need to know to understand and enjoy
\end{itemize}
% \item Rewrite it using only the most common 1,000 words of English
%   \begin{itemize}
%   \item Like XKCD's \href{https://xkcd.com/simplewriter/}{Simple Writer}
%     (used in \textit{Thing Explainer})
%   \item We only did this for \sh{REDH}

%\section{Word Meaning Revisited}

\myslide{Defining Meaning}

\begin{itemize}\addtolength{\itemsep}{-1ex}
\item When we use a word, we don't have to know everything about the
  referent
  \begin{itemize}%\addtolength{\itemsep}{-.25ex}
  \item A \eng{dog-cart} is a kind of \con{cart}
  \item[\ent] you can ride it
  \item[\ent] it has wheels
  \item[\ent] it has something to do with a dog
  \end{itemize}
\item We infer that it has many of the same properties as its
  hypernym, even though this is not always true
 \begin{itemize}%\addtolength{\itemsep}{-.25ex}
  \item A \eng{hover-car} is a kind of \con{car}
  \item[\ent] you can ride it
  \item[$\not\Rightarrow$] it has wheels

\myslide{What if there is mutual information?}  
\MyLogo{Context Helps}
\begin{itemize}
\item \txx{Mutual information} measures the information that $X$ and $Y$ share:
how much does knowing one variable reduce our
uncertainty about the other.
\begin{itemize}
\item What is the next letter?
\item What is the next letter following \textit{t}?
\item What is the next letter following \textit{a}?
\item What is the next letter following \textit{q}?
\item What is the next letter following \textit{th}?
\item What is the next letter following \textit{as}?
\item What is the next letter following \textit{qu}?
\item What is the next letter following \textit{semanti}?
\end{itemize}
\item A language model and more context improves our guess
\end{itemize}


\myslide{Different Models for English}

Consider only 26 lowercase letters and a space, and a language model
based on probability (Hidden Markov Model).  How many guesses do we
need on average to guess the next letter?

\begin{itemize}
\item Zeroth order (random) = $\log_2$ 27 = 4.76
\item First order (frequency) = 4.03 \hfill (pick \textit{e})
\item Second order (one previous letter) = 2.8
\item Human (two previous letters) = 1.34
\end{itemize}

Surrounding context helps interpretation


\myslide{What if there is noise?}

\begin{itemize}
\item Imagine you want to send a signal, but randomly a bit gets flipped (noise)
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Original message /pa/ 100 01
  \item Received message /ka/ 101 01
  \end{itemize}
\item A very efficient model is weak to noise
\item If we make the message longer, we can guard against this
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Original message /pa/ 100 100 100 01 01 01
  \item Received message /ka/ 101 100 100 01 01 01
\\   We add \blu{redundancy} to the signal
\item There are much better encodings than this (\blu{Hamming codes})

\myslide{Bandwidth}
\MyLogo{1 wpm $\approx$ 6x8 bits/60 seconds = 0.8 bits/second}
\begin{itemize}
\item \txx{Bandwidth} (or \txx{bit-rate}) is the maximum throughput of
  a logical or physical communication path in a digital communication
  system: e.g. how much information can be conveyed
\item Human Communication: words per minute (one word is 6 characters)
% 1 wpm = 6x8 bits/60 seconds = .8 bits/second
