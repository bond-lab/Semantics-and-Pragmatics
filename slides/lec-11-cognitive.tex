\section{Revision: Formal Semantics}

% \myslide{Language meets Logic (again)}

% \begin{itemize}
% \item \txx{formal semantics} is also known as
%   \begin{itemize}
%   \item \txx{truth-conditional semantics}
%   \item \txx{model-theoretic semantics}
%   \item \txx{Montague Grammar}
%   \item \txx{logical semantics}
%   \end{itemize}
% \item A general attempt to link the meaning of sentences to the
%   circumstances of the world: \txx{correspondence theory}
%   \begin{itemize}
%   \item If the meaning of the sentence and the state of the world
%     \emp{correspond} then the sentence is \textbf{true}
%   \end{itemize}
% \end{itemize}

% \myslide{Model-Theoretical Semantics}

% \begin{enumerate}
% \item Translate from a natural language into a logical language
%   with explicitly defined syntax and semantics
% \item Establish a mathematical model of the situations that the
%   language describes
% \item Establish procedures for checking the mapping between the
%   expressions in the logical language and the modeled situations.
% \end{enumerate}


% \myslide{Translating English into a Logical Metalanguage}
% %\myslide{Empirical truths and connectives}
% \MyLogo{Recall lecture 4}
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Consider simple sentences
%   \begin{itemize}
%   \item Represent the predicates by a capital \txx{predicate letter}
%     \\ these can be n-ary
%   \item Represent the \txx{individual constants} by lower case letters
%   \item Represent \txx{variables} by lower case letters (x,y,z)
%   \end{itemize}
% \item Join simple sentences with logical connectives
% \\ treat relative clauses as \txx{and}
%   \begin{exe}

% \myslide{Creating a \txx{Model}}

% \begin{enumerate}\addtolength{\itemsep}{-1.5ex}
% \item a \txx{semantic interpretation} of the symbols of the predicate logic
% \item a \txx{domain}: the model of a situation which identifies the
%   linguistically relevant entities, properties and relations
% \item a \txx{denotation assignment function}: this is a procedure
%   which matches the linguistic elements with the items  that they denote (a \txx{naming function})
% \end{enumerate}
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Is the denotation correct (does it match the real world)?
%   \begin{itemize}
%   \item \textbf{Sentence} 
%     $p$ is true in situation $v$ if it corresponds with the real world: 
%     \\ {[$p$]$^v$ = 1}: the denotatum of $p$ in $v$ is true
%   \item \textbf{Constant} denotation of a constant is the individual entity in question
%   \item \textbf{Predicate constants} are sets of individuals for which the predicate holds
% \\ {\{$<x, y, z>$: $x$ hands $y$ to $z$\}}
%   \end{itemize}

% \end{itemize}

% \myslide{The Domain}

% \begin{itemize}
% \item The domain represents the individuals and representations in a situation $v$
% \item Combine this with an assignment function $F$ to form a model
% \\ $M_1 = <U_1, F_1>$ (or set of models: $M_2 = <U_1, F_2>$, \ldots)
% \end{itemize}

% \myslide{Evaluating a simple statement}

  \end{itemize}
\item We need to restrict the quantification
  \begin{itemize}

\section{Cognitive Semantics}

\myslide{Introduction}

\begin{itemize}
\item Cognitive linguistics sees language as embedded in its use
  \begin{itemize}
  \item a \txx{functional} approach to language
  \item considering \txx{diachronic} and not just \txx{synchronic} evidence
  \item little or no separation between syntax, semantics and pragmatics
  \end{itemize}
\item The basic idea is that one thing is characterized in terms of another
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \txx{Metaphor} and \txx{figurative} language
  \item \txx{Image Schemas}
  \item \txx{Mental Spaces}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\myslide{Figurative language use}

\begin{exe}
\ex \eng{Our new boss is a dinosaur}
\ex \eng{She fought for her life [in hospital]}
\ex \eng{His mind was racing}
\ex \eng{The ham skated across the kitchen floor}
\ex \eng{The brandy tobogganed down his throat}
\end{exe}
% \myslide{Metaphors}

% Natural culinary selection has led to the evolution of wildly
% varied pasta shapes â€“ some estimates put it at well over 300- many
% of which were specifically designed to go with a particular kind of
% sauce.
% Generally, the more convoluted the pasta shape, the more
% sauce will cling to it, and the chunkier the sauce it can accompany.
% Strand pastas, such as spaghetti, are good all-rounders. Their
% slim strands are easily coated by thinner sauces, but when stirred
% and tangled together, they can also carry the thicker sauce.
% Ribbon pasta like fettuccine and linguine are even better at
% holding on to thicker sauces, especially if they have ruffled edges.
% Shaped pastas, like bowties, shells and wheels, typically have
% crevices, nooks and ridges that are great for catching chunky
% sauces. The larger types, such as conchiglioni, are big enough to fill
% with stuffing.
% Tube pastas run a very wide gamut of lengths, widths,
% twistiness and ruggedness, from everyoneâ€™s favourite , maccheroni,
% to long hollow buccatini, to fat ridged stuffable rigatoni
% Artisanal pasta (labelled artiginale) is more expensive than
% ordinary pasta, but worth it. Itâ€™s made in small batches from finest
% quality wheat, using bronze moulds which leave tiny microscopic
% ridges on the pasta surface that increase its ability to hold on to
% sauce.

\myslide{Metaphors and Mechanisms of Interpretation}

A metaphor is an extension of the use of a word beyond its
primary meaning to describe referents that bear similarities to
the wordâ€™s primary referent.
\begin{itemize}
\item \lex{eye} ``body part used for vision''
  \begin{exe}
  \ex \eng{dull end of a needle (with a hole for the thread)}
  \ex \eng{the bud on a potato}
  \ex \eng{the centre of a storm}
  \end{exe}
\item The similarities between these referents and the primary referent of
the word \lex{eye} are:
\begin{itemize}
\item roundish shape
\item more or less central location on a larger shape
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\myslide{Grammaticalization}
\begin{itemize}
\item Once a metaphor becomes accepted, speakers tend to view the
metaphorical meaning as separated from its primary meaning

\begin{exe}
  \ex \eng{booking a flight}
  \ex \eng{tabling a motion}
  \ex \eng{seeing the point}
  \ex \eng{stealing the headlines}
  \ex \eng{buying time}
\end{exe}
\item These are \txx{dead} or \txx{frozen metaphors}: we don't need to
  specially process them
\item We would expect to find them in a lexicon like wordnet
\end{itemize}

\myslide{Metaphors as non-prototypical use}

\begin{itemize}
\item In a way, metaphors are non-prototypical uses of a word.
\begin{itemize}
\item Humans understand words by referring to a prototypical usage,
and they match a new example against the characteristics of the
prototype.
\item  Use of words with broken typicality conditions happens all the
time.
\end{itemize}
\item
  \begin{exe}
    \ex \eng{The price of brussel sprouts went up.}
    \ex \eng{Marigold is coming out of a coma.}
    \ex \eng{Felix is under age.}
    \ex \eng{I killed his argument.}
    \ex \eng{Their love affair is blossoming.}
    \ex \eng{She has a fertile imagination.}
  \end{exe}
\item Depending on how you count frozen metaphors, 
we use metaphors more than literal uses
\end{itemize}

\myslide{Metaphors as central to understanding}
% \begin{exe}
%   \ex \eng{Her heart drummed against her rib-cage \ex \eng{The music flowed over
%   her \ex \eng{The evening staggered/plodded on

\begin{quote}
  \Large Our conceptual system is fundamentally
metaphorical in nature
\end{quote}
\begin{flushright}
  George Lakoff
\end{flushright}

\begin{itemize}
\item Cognitive semantics:
\\ There is no separation between cognition and
linguistic knowledge
\item Features of Metaphor
\begin{itemize}
\item \txx{Conventional} some metaphors are very well established (but
  remain metaphorical)
\item \txx{Systematic} understood as part of larger domains
\item \txx{Asymmetrical} normally understand the \emp{abstract} 
  in terms of the \emp{concrete}
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}


\myslide{Metaphors we live by}

\begin{itemize}
\item Metaphor is pervasive in everyday life, not just in
language but in thought and action.
\item Our ordinary conceptual system, in terms of which we
both think and act, is fundamentally metaphorical in
nature.
\item If we are right in suggesting that our conceptual system
is largely metaphorical, then the way we think, what we
experience, and what we do every day is very much a
matter of metaphor.
\end{itemize}

\end{quote}



\myslide{Prototypical metaphors}

Some metaphors are not as good as others because not all broken typicality
conditions result in prototypical metaphors. What is a prototypical
metaphor?

\begin{itemize}
\item Similarity and dissimilarity have both been stressed.
\item Items must not be too similar:
  \begin{exe}
    \ex \eng{$^\#$Wine is whisky}
    \ex \eng{$^\#$Cars are trucks}
    \ex \eng{$^\#$Jam is honey}
  \end{exe}
\newpage
\item They should not be too dissimilar:
  \begin{exe}
    \ex \eng{His feet were stars}
    \ex \eng{Her cheeks were typewriters}
    \ex \eng{Her knees were penguins}
  \end{exe}
\item In a prototypical metaphor then, items compared are
likely to come from different lexical fields but they are
also similar in that they do share some minor
characteristic. Dissimilarity signals the listener to do
some active semantic matching.
\begin{exe}
  \ex \eng{Life is a subway train}
  \ex \eng{Men are thistles}
  \ex \eng{He posted the toast down to his stomach}
\end{exe}
\end{itemize}

\myslide{Target and Source Domains}

% \begin{exe}
%   \ex \eng{The cake was absolutely wicked.
% \iz The chocolate crÃ¨me was just plain sinful. I feel guilty eating it.

\begin{quote}
 Metaphors enable us to understand one
  domain of experience in terms of another.
\\ \mbox{}\hfill \citet{Lakoff:Turner:1989}

\ex \eng{If you use that strategy, heâ€™ll wipe you out.}
\ex \eng{He shot down all my arguments.}
\ex \eng{He was defeated by the argument.}
\end{exe}
\newpage
\begin{itemize}
\item We donâ€™t just talk about argument in terms of war. We can actually win or
lose arguments.
\item  Many of the things we do in arguing are partially structured by the concept of war.
Though there is no physical battle, there is a verbal battle.
\begin{itemize}
  \item  We see the person we are arguing with as an opponent.
  \item  We attack their positions and defend our own.
  \item  We gain and lose ground.
  \item  We plan and use strategies.
 \end{itemize}

\item The metaphor is not only in the words we use --- it is in our very concept of argument.  We talk about arguments that way because we conceive of them that way --- and we
act according to the way we conceive of things
\item But we could think of an argument as a search for truth, \ldots
\end{itemize}

  \item Suppose you and I have an argument. You believe a proposition, P, and I donâ€™t. Iâ€™ve objected, Iâ€™ve questioned, Iâ€™ve raised all sorts of counter-considerations, and in every case youâ€™ve responded to my satisfaction. At the end of the day, I say, â€˜You know what? I guess youâ€™re right.â€™
  \item So I have a new belief. And itâ€™s not just any belief, but itâ€™s a well-articulated, examined and battle-tested belief.
  \item So who won that argument? Well, the war metaphor seems to force us into saying you won, even though Iâ€™m the only one who made any cognitive gain.
  \item The war metaphor forces us into thinking that youâ€™re the winner and I lost, even though I gained and thereâ€™s something wrong with that picture.

\begin{itemize}
\item \txx{Spatial metaphors} have to do with
spatial orientation: \lex{up-down, in-out, front-back, on-off, deep-shallow, 
central-peripheral}.

\item Spatial metaphors give a concept a spatial orientation eg.
HAPPY is UP: \eng{I'm feeling up today}
\item Though polar oppositions \eng{up-down, in-out} are physical in nature, the spatial
metaphors based on them can vary from culture to culture. (e.g. in most 
cultures FUTURE is FRONT but in at least one FUTURE is BACK)
\begin{itemize}

  Chile, have future behind them

\myslide{ANGER}

\begin{itemize}\addtolength{\itemsep}{-1ex}
\item Emotions are often considered to be feelings alone, and
as such they are viewed as being devoid of conceptual
content.
\item In fact emotions have a fairly complex conceptual
structure which can be studied through metaphors.
\item Lakoff and Johnson's cultural model of anger
\\ Physiological effects of anger:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Increased body heat
  \item Increased internal pressure
  \item Agitation
  \item Interference with accurate perception
  \item As anger increases, the physiological effect increases
  \item There is a limit beyond which the physiological effects of anger impair normal functioning.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\newpage
\begin{itemize}
\item Body heat:
  \begin{exe}
    \ex \eng{Don't get hot under the collar.}
    \ex \eng{Billy's a hothead.}
    \ex \eng{They were having a heated argument.}
    \ex \eng{She got all hot and bothered.}
  \end{exe}
  \item Internal pressure:
  \begin{exe}
    \ex \eng{When I found out, I almost burst a blood vessel.}
    \ex \eng{He almost had a hemorrhage.}
    \ex \eng{I exploded at them.}
  \end{exe}
\newpage
\item Redness in the face and neck area:
  \begin{exe}
    \ex \eng{She was scarlet with rage.}
    \ex \eng{He got red with anger.}
    \ex \eng{He was flushed with anger.}
  \end{exe}
\item Agitation
\begin{exe}
  \ex \eng{She was shaking with anger.}
  \ex \eng{I was hopping mad.}
  \ex \eng{He was quivering with rage.}
  \ex \eng{He's all worked up.}
 \ex \eng{She's all wrought up.}
\end{exe}
\newpage
\item Interference with accurate perception
\begin{exe}
  \ex \eng{She was blind with rage.}
  \ex \eng{I was beginning to see red.}
  \ex \eng{I was so mad I couldn't see straight.}
\end{exe}
\end{itemize}

\myslide{ANGER is HEAT}

\begin{itemize}
\item ANGER is HEAT forms the basis of the most
  general metaphors for anger
\item There are two versions to this metaphor,
  one where the heat is applied to fluid and
  the other where the heat is applied to
  solids.
\item The fluid version is more elaborated
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item The body is a container for the emotions
\begin{exe}
  \ex \eng{He was filled with anger.}
  \ex \eng{She couldn't contain her joy.}
  \ex \eng{She was brimming with rage.}
  \ex \eng{Try to get the anger out of your system.}
\end{exe}
\item
The ANGER is HEAT metaphor when applied to fluids combines with the
metaphor the body is a container for the emotions to yield the central
metaphor of the system:
\item ANGER is HEAT OF A FLUID in a container.
\begin{exe}
  \ex \eng{You make my blood boil.}
  \ex \eng{Simmer down!}
  \ex \eng{I had reached the boiling point.}
  \ex \eng{Let him stew.}
  \ex \eng{She was seething with rage.}
\end{exe}

\item Similarly \lex{pissed off} is used only to refer to anger --- ``hot liquid under
pressure''
\item Cool and calm corresponds to the lack of anger.
\begin{exe}
  \ex \eng{Keep cool.}
  \ex \eng{Stay calm.}
\end{exe}

\item When The Intensity Of Anger Increases The Fluid Rises
\begin{exe}
  \ex \eng{His pent-up anger welled up inside him.}
  \ex \eng{She could feel her gorge rising.}
  \ex \eng{We got a rise out of him.}
  \ex \eng{My anger kept building up inside me.}
  \ex \eng{Pretty soon I was in a towering rage.}
\end{exe}
\newpage
\item We also know that intense heat produces steam and creates pressure on the
container. This yields the metaphorical entailments:
\item Intense Anger Produces Pressure On The Container
  \begin{exe}
    \ex \eng{He was bursting with anger.}
    \ex \eng{I could barely contain my rage.}
    \ex \eng{I could barely keep it in any more.}
    \ex \eng{He suppressed his anger.}
    \ex \eng{They turned their anger inward.}
    \ex \eng{He managed to keep his anger bottled up inside him.}
%    \ex \eng{He was blue in the face.}
\end{exe}
\newpage
\item  When the pressure on the container becomes too high, the container explodes.
\item When Anger Becomes Too Intense The Person Explodes
  \begin{exe}
    \ex \eng{When I told him, he just exploded.}
  \ex \eng{She blew up at me.}
  \ex \eng{We don't like your outbursts.}
  \ex \eng{She blew a fuse.}
  \ex \eng{He blew a gasket.}
  \ex \eng{He erupted.}
\end{exe}
\newpage
\item When A Person Explodes, Parts Of Them Go Up In The Air.
  \begin{exe}
  \ex \eng{I blew my stack.}
  \ex \eng{I blew my top.}
  \ex \eng{She flipped her lid.}
  \ex \eng{He hit the ceiling.}
  \ex \eng{I went through the roof.}
\end{exe}

\newpage

\item The central metaphor of Anger as heated fluid in a container indicate
that the anger scale is not open-ended, it has a limit. Just as hot
fluid in a closed container can only take so much heat before it
explodes, so we conceptualise the anger scale as having a limit
point. We can only bear so much anger before we explode.
\item The conceptual metaphors are motivated by our physiology
\item There may be cross-cultural differences
\item And there are many possible metaphors

\begin{itemize}
\item ANGER is FIRE
\item ANGER is INSANITY
\item ANGER is an OPPONENT
\item ANGER is a DANGEROUS ANIMAL
\end{itemize}

\myslide{Metaphor and Politics}

\begin{itemize}
\item \citet{Lakoff:1995} states that different political groups base their
  understanding of the world on different metaphors
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \txx{nurturant parent} (liberal) family is one that revolves
    around every family member caring for and being cared for by every
    other family member, with open communication between all parties,
    and with each family member pursuing their own vision of
    happiness.
  \item \txx{strict father} (conservative) family revolves around the idea that parents teach their children how to be self-reliant and self-disciplined through "tough love". 
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\myslide{Nurturant Parent}

\begin{itemize}
\item     Morality: The basis of morality is in understanding, respecting, and helping other people, and in seeking the happiness of one's self and of others. The primary vices are selfishness and anti-social behavior.
\item   Child development: Children develop morality primarily through interacting with and observing good people, especially good parents. Punishment is necessary in some cases, but also has the potential to backfire, causing children to adopt more violent or more anti-social ways. Though children should, in general, obey their parents, they will develop best if allowed to question their parents' decisions. Moral development is a life-long process, and almost no one is so perfect as not to need improvement.
\item     Justice: The world is not without justice, but it is far from the ideal of justice. Many people, for example, do not seem properly rewarded for their hard work and dedication. We must work hard to improve everyone's condition.
\end{itemize}

\myslide{Strict Father}

\begin{itemize}
\item     Morality: Evil is all around us, constantly tempting us. Thus, the basis of morality is strong moral character, which requires self-reliance and self-discipline. The primary vices are those that dissolve self-discipline, such as laziness, gluttony, and indulgent sexuality.
\item     Child development: Children develop self-discipline, self-reliance, and other virtues primarily through rewards and punishment, a system of "tough love". Since parents know the difference between right and wrong and children still do not, obedience to the parents is very important. Moral development basically lasts only as long as childhood; it's important to get it right the first time, because there is no "second chance".
\item 
    Justice: The world may be a difficult place to live, but it is basically just; people usually get what they deserve. The difficulties in one's life serve as a test to sort the deserving from the undeserving.
